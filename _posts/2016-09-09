Bullet Journal 
--------------

In yet another attempt at productivity and getting things done, I have started giving the Bullet Journal methodology a trial run. There is something simple about using paper rather than yet another app that would phase out of use within a week so I am hoping to go with the 2 month trial as suggested by the creator and see if it sticks and is helpful.
