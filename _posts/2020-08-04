snitch.cjc.im
---------

Resurrected an old project that was a basic URL canary tool

You can find and use it at [snitch.cjc.im](https://snitch.cjc.im). 

This is definitely not a replacement for a real canary product, but its a nice little tool to see if anything is potentially "snitching" on links you send.
