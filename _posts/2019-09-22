All aboard the Hype Train- Librem5
---------------

So the team at [Purism](https://puri.sm) have [announced](https://puri.sm/posts/librem-5-shipping-announcement/) their shipping schedule. 
The hype train is getting ready to leave, all aboard! ðŸš‚ðŸšƒðŸšƒðŸšƒ

I've had a long time fascination with the idea of having a single computer to fill all my daily needs. 
From scrolling through Twitter, to doing light development work on. 
In the past I've attempted this with a few devices, including, but not limited to:

* Nokia n900
* A Raspberry Pi 0 as a USB computer / used with a NexDock
* Tiny laptops (netbooks?) like the Toshiba Libretto series, or the Asus eeepc701
* Various Android devices with a chroot install
* The Dell Streak 5

I never was able to give Windows Mobile a go with continuum, which looked pretty cool, but they are ending support in December 2019. 
The same goes for modern Samsung Phones using Samsung Dex (although I worry about android phones getting updates beyond a year or two). 
That's why I've stuck to a combination of a laptop (Lenovo x230) and a smart phone.

I am really hoping the Librem5 will be able to act not only as my phone, but with either a dock, or the NexDock I still have, fulfill my 
usual computing needs!

As soon as I find out which batch I am in, and I receive my device, I will be writing about it as much as possible, documenting 
the positives and the negatives! My main worry is certain apps being unavailable for a Linux based phone.

Bye for now!
