Pride.py
---------------

Well, I've decided to rewrite the Static Site Generator in Python for a more
cross platform experience. Here's hoping it works.

For now it's merely a direct functionality port to python, inefficient and
slow, but the site is working. I can now start making the functionality 
better, introduce some templating and better features.

I also updated the style... again. (still no dirty JavaScript though!)
