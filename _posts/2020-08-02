paste.cjc.im
---------

It's been a while again!

I've been working on the same side-project (onlooker) for over a year, and had the desire to make something else.

In a virtual hack-a-thon I have created [paste.cjc.im](https://paste.cjc.im) which is a simple pastebin-style tool. 

What makes this different from others is:

* Data is encrypted using the browser's crypto module using AES-CBC
* The "paste" is stored in the anchor of the URL, and thus never gets sent to the server. (This was partially a feature, and partially so I don't have to run any sort of storage or API üëç)

For example [this](https://paste.cjc.im/#eyJkYXRhIjoi0q9cdTAwMTHnXHRH5ld/e5fIXGbo7PpU/alBQTRcdKDoO0MkkO/6jCIsIml2Ijoi/mtWmadcXKBw3mIsa046npQifQ==) has the key "superSEKRETkey"

The anchor part of the URL contains a javascript object encoded in base64 that contains the ciphertext and the initialisation vector.

As part of this I also put together [qr.cjc.im](https://qr.cjc.im) that can encode a paste into a single QR code for sharing in meatspace, the same paste as above:
