Onlooker Research 2 US Elections
---------

### What
Collection of just over 3000 screenshots of domains related to the US election of 2020. 

### Why
Because it's interesting to see what domains are registered based on current events, and there are some amusing discoveries. I noticed that there are significantly more Trump related domains than there were Biden, perhaps he is just more interesting? 

### How
My side project, onlooker, monitors for several things such as DNS changes, potential hostile domains for your brand etc. I wanted to test in-line screenshoting and monitoring for keywords rather than just pure domains. 
All of the included screenshots are from domains that have been discovered on the certificate transparency log.

### Methodology 
The basic idea here, was to select some keywords that were related to the two main contenders of the US Election and see what happened, I didn't expect to find so many in such a short time. The test ran from November the 3rd 2020 until November the 16th 2020.

The keywords were: 

* Trump
* Potus
* Biden
* Sleepyjoe (Recommended by Lee)

After collecting all the screenshots, I used a few patterns as below to remove a LOT of false positives. 

* Autodiscover. 
* cpanel.
* spectrum
* centrum
* trumpfmed
* strumpf
* electrum
* identity

### Download:

I will be seeding this for the foreseeable future :) Be warned I have NOT removed any adult or offensive content that may have appeared on these domains.
