---------

This week in the world of Infosec and beyond! (Also reader mode in Firefox and Safari Mobile = a usable web, almost)

* [Major ASP.NET hosting provider infected by ransomware](https://www.zdnet.com/article/major-asp-net-hosting-provider-infected-by-ransomware/) - Another webhosting provider hit by ransomware, with the not just the customer data, but the provider data being subject to the ransom.
* [Google Begins Testing Extension Manifest V3 in Chrome Canary](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/software/google-begins-testing-extension-manifest-v3-in-chrome-canary/) - Newer versions of Chrome change so that the `webRequest` API so that addons can only monitor requests and not modify them, essentially neutering most AdBlocking software, what a *surprise* from an Advertising Behemoth like Google. I read somewhere that this might still be allowed in enterprise deployments… great use for the average user there. 
* [Apple Store worker texts himself customer's intimate photo](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-50405688) - An abuse of trust by an Apple employee whilst working on a customer's phone. It's quite scary how much these little devices become our most trusted store of personal data.

In a statement made on twitter, operation and production systems continue to operate normally.
* [Cyber Emergency!](https://www.itnews.com.au/news/malware-drive-by-attack-triggered-australias-first-cyber-emergency-534028) 🚨🚨🚨**CYBER EMERGENCY** 🚨🚨🚨 Spawning from a website that had been compromised, a small number of users were infected with malware that is claimed to be part of a state sponsored attack.
* [Let's get the party started](https://news.sky.com/story/wild-boar-discover-and-snort-17000-of-cocaine-in-tuscan-forest-11861940) - Wild boars snort a hell of a lot of nose candy! 👃🍬
