Opengraph and twitter meta tags for pride
---------------

In my ongoing efforts to improve my static site generator, [pride](https://github.com/i-am-cjc/pride), to be a little more generic, I have added some basic meta tags for when sharing pages / posts. 

I have also created the first iteration of the [onlooker.io](https://onlooker.io) site that is using this static site generator.

Hopefully, when I post this onto twitter after uploading it will work ðŸ¤žðŸ¤žðŸ¤ž
