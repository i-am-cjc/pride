Automata on the Nintendo GameBoy
---------

It's been a while.

I recently saw the sad news that [John Conway](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Horton_Conway) has passed away. 
This reminded me of a time in 2012 when I wrote a Cellular Automata "game" for the Nintendo GameBoy 
as part of the [Ludum Dare](http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-24/) game jam.

I had to make a few improvements tonight before uploading it, and I am very impressed with the fact that I can 
spin up a Docker container and install the Gameboy Dev KIT rpm file I have had since then and it allowed me to 
compile a new version of the rom without any issues. What a time to be alive.

[Here](/files/Automata.gb) you can download it and have a play.

RIP Mr Conway.
