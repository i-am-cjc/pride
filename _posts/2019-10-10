Pride Updates for onlooker.io
---------------

onlooker.io needs something on the website, I don't particularly have any skills in web design (have you seen this wonderful styling on here!). I've spent a bit of time changing Pride, my static site generator, to be a little more generic so I can use it to create a website and blog for onlooker focussed shizzle.

Simple changes thanks to the external config added, such as site name, base url, author name etc can now all be used.
